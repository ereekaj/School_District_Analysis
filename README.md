# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
I've been working on analyzing math and reading testing scores for a school district where Maria works.  Now the school board has notified Maria the data we originaly used show evidence of academic dishonesty. I have been tasked with replacing the math and reading scores for 9th grade students at Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, redoing all of my analysis on the school district data and describing how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?

- How is the school summary affected?

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  
  - Scores by school spending
  
  - Scores by school size
  
  - Scores by school type

## Summary: 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
